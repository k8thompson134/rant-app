# RantTrack Terms of Service

**Last Updated**: December 30, 2024
**Effective Date**: December 30, 2024

## Welcome to RantTrack

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of RantTrack, a privacy-first symptom tracker for chronically ill people. By using RantTrack, you agree to these Terms.

**The short version**: Be kind, don't do illegal things, understand this is a tool not a doctor, and we're not responsible if things go wrong. Your data is yours and stays on your device.

---

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using RantTrack, you agree to these Terms. If you don't agree, please don't use the app.

**Age Requirement**: You must be at least 13 years old to use RantTrack. If you're under 18, please get permission from a parent or guardian before using health tracking apps.

---

## 2. What RantTrack Is (and Isn't)

### RantTrack IS:
- ✅ A **symptom tracking tool** to help you log and understand your health patterns
- ✅ A **communication aid** for sharing symptom histories with your healthcare providers
- ✅ A **personal health journal** that stays private on your device

### RantTrack IS NOT:
- ❌ A medical device
- ❌ A diagnostic tool (we don't diagnose conditions)
- ❌ Medical advice (we don't tell you what treatments to pursue)
- ❌ A replacement for professional healthcare
- ❌ FDA approved or regulated

**Important**: Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical advice, diagnosis, and treatment. RantTrack is a tracking tool, not a medical authority.

---

## 3. Your Responsibilities

By using RantTrack, you agree to:

### Use the App Legally
- Follow all applicable laws and regulations
- Not use RantTrack for illegal purposes
- Not attempt to hack, reverse engineer, or compromise the app's security

### Use at Your Own Risk
- Understand that RantTrack may contain bugs or errors
- Take responsibility for your own health decisions
- Not rely solely on RantTrack for medical decisions
- Back up important data (by exporting it when that feature is available)

### Respect Our Values
- Not use RantTrack to exploit, harm, or discriminate against others
- Not submit false bug reports or spam our support channels
- Not attempt to commercialize or redistribute the app without permission

---

## 4. Privacy & Your Data

**Your data belongs to you.** Here's what that means:

### Data Ownership
- **You own all symptom entries, rants, and health data** you create in RantTrack
- Your data is stored **locally on your device only**
- We **never** access, collect, or store your health data on our servers
- You can delete all data anytime by deleting the app

### Data Responsibility
- **You're responsible for backing up your data** - we can't recover it if lost
- **You control who sees your data** - if you export and share it, that's your choice
- **You understand the risks of local-only storage** - if you lose your device, your data is gone

See our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for complete details.

---

## 5. Intellectual Property

### RantTrack's IP
- RantTrack's code, design, branding, and documentation are owned by [Kate Thompson / Your Legal Entity]
- RantTrack is licensed under an open source license (see GitHub repository for details)
- You may not redistribute RantTrack under a different name or brand without permission

### Your IP
- **You retain all rights to the content you create** in RantTrack (your symptom entries, rants, etc.)
- You grant us **no rights** to your health data (because we never have access to it)
- If you share feedback or feature suggestions, we may use those to improve RantTrack

---

## 6. Disclaimers

### Medical Disclaimer
**RantTrack is not a substitute for professional medical advice.**

- We don't diagnose conditions
- We don't recommend treatments
- We don't validate symptom entries (the NLP may misinterpret your text)
- We don't guarantee accuracy of symptom extraction or tracking
- **Always consult your doctor for medical decisions**

### Accuracy Disclaimer
The NLP symptom extraction algorithm:
- May misinterpret your entries (e.g., missing symptoms, wrong severity)
- Is based on pattern matching, not medical expertise
- Improves over time but will never be 100% accurate
- Requires user confirmation - **always review extracted symptoms**

### No Warranty
RantTrack is provided **"AS-IS" without any warranty of any kind**, including but not limited to:
- **No guarantee of availability** - the app may have bugs, crashes, or downtime
- **No guarantee of accuracy** - symptom extraction may be wrong
- **No guarantee of data persistence** - data could be lost due to device issues, app bugs, or user error
- **No guarantee of fitness for a particular purpose** - we hope it helps, but we can't promise it will

In legal terms: **RantTrack is provided without warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.**

---

## 7. Limitation of Liability

**To the maximum extent permitted by law**, the RantTrack developers, contributors, and distributors are **not liable** for:

### Data Loss
- Loss of symptom entries due to device failure, app deletion, or bugs
- Inability to recover data (we have no backups of your local data)
- Corruption of data or database errors

### Medical Outcomes
- Medical decisions made based on RantTrack data
- Missed or misinterpreted symptoms
- Delayed diagnosis due to reliance on tracking instead of seeking medical care
- Any health-related harm resulting from app use

### Technical Issues
- App crashes, bugs, or errors
- Incompatibility with your device or OS version
- Failure of voice recognition or NLP extraction
- Security vulnerabilities (though we'll fix them promptly if discovered)

### Indirect or Consequential Damages
- Lost time, productivity, or opportunity
- Emotional distress
- Any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages

**In plain English**: We're building this app to help chronically ill people, but we can't guarantee it'll be perfect. Use it as a tool, not a replacement for medical care. If something goes wrong, we're sorry, but we're not legally responsible.

---

## 8. Indemnification

You agree to **indemnify and hold harmless** RantTrack's developers from any claims, damages, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from:
- Your use or misuse of the app
- Your violation of these Terms
- Your violation of any laws or third-party rights

**Translation**: If you use RantTrack to do something illegal or harmful and someone sues us, you're responsible, not us.

---

## 9. Changes to the App

We may:
- Add new features
- Fix bugs
- Change the user interface
- Update the NLP algorithm
- Discontinue features (with notice)

We'll try to avoid breaking changes, but we can't guarantee the app will work identically forever.

### Your Choices
If you don't like updates:
- Don't install the update (stay on your current version)
- Stop using the app (delete it)
- Fork the open source code and maintain your own version

---

## 10. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms occasionally. If we make material changes, we'll:
1. Update the "Last Updated" date at the top
2. Notify you in the app (e.g., a notice on first launch after the update)
3. Give you a chance to review the new Terms

**Your continued use of RantTrack after Terms changes means you accept the new Terms.**

If you don't agree with updated Terms, stop using the app.

---

## 11. Termination

### You Can Stop Using RantTrack Anytime
- No account to close
- No cancellation process
- Just delete the app and you're done

### We Can Terminate Your Access If:
- You violate these Terms
- You attempt to harm the app, other users, or us
- Required by law

(In practice, this is unlikely since RantTrack is local-only and we don't have user accounts. But we reserve the right to block access if needed.)

---

## 12. Open Source License

RantTrack's source code is available on GitHub under [SPECIFY LICENSE - e.g., MIT, GPL, Apache 2.0].

You may:
- View the source code
- Report bugs and security issues
- Contribute improvements
- Fork the code (subject to the license terms)

**Open source doesn't mean "no terms"** - you still agree to these Terms when using the app, and the code license governs what you can do with the source code.

---

## 13. Third-Party Services

RantTrack may integrate with third-party services (e.g., Google Forms for feedback). Use of those services is subject to their own terms and privacy policies, not RantTrack's.

**Current third-party services**:
- **Expo** (app development framework) - see [Expo's Terms](https://expo.dev/terms)
- **Google Forms** (optional feedback submission) - see [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- **iOS/Android Speech Recognition APIs** (if you use voice input) - see Apple/Google's privacy policies

We don't control these services and aren't responsible for their practices.

---

## 14. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of **Wisconsin, United States**, without regard to conflict of law principles.

Any disputes must be resolved in the courts of **Milwaukee County, Wisconsin**.

**International Users**: If you're outside the United States, you agree to comply with your local laws regarding app use and health data.

---

## 15. Severability

If any part of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the rest of the Terms still apply.

---

## 16. Entire Agreement

These Terms, along with our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md), constitute the entire agreement between you and RantTrack.

There are no other promises, representations, or agreements (verbal or written) beyond what's in these documents.

---

## 17. No Class Actions

You agree to resolve disputes individually, not as part of a class action or representative proceeding.

---

## 18. Export Compliance

If you're outside the United States, you're responsible for complying with local laws regarding software use and data export.

RantTrack is a civilian app and should not be used in ways that violate export control regulations.

---

## 19. Accessibility

We strive to make RantTrack accessible to people with disabilities, cognitive dysfunction, and chronic illness.

If you encounter accessibility issues, please report them via GitHub or the in-app feedback form so we can improve.

## Summary: The Spirit of These Terms

We wrote these Terms to protect both you and us, but here's the real spirit:

**RantTrack exists to help chronically ill people track their symptoms with minimal friction.** We're not trying to exploit you, sell your data, or avoid responsibility for gross negligence.

These Terms are here to:
1. Clarify that we're a **tool, not a doctor**
2. Explain that we can't guarantee perfection (we're human, software has bugs)
3. Protect against misuse
4. Comply with legal requirements for app distribution

**If you have questions or concerns**, please reach out. We're a small project run by people who care about the chronic illness community.

Use RantTrack in good faith, and we'll support you in good faith. 💙
